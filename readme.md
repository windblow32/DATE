# Exploring the Heterogeneity of Tabular Data: A Diversity-aware Data Generator via LLMs

Welcome to **DATE**, a LLM-based tabular data generator for heterogenous data. We present our **Source Code** and **Appendix** for users. 

For detailed proofs and external experiments in the original paper, please read our [appendix](appendix.pdf).

To obtain the public data used in our experiment, please refer to the IEEE Dataport: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/heterogeneous-data-augmentation-benchmark.

For running Module 1: DGR-based Prompt Designing, please refer to [ModelShare_with_DSR_final.py](ModelShare_with_DSR_final.py).

For running Module 2: Distribution-Specific Generation, please refer to [dataGeneration.py](dataGeneration.py).

Files with the `test_` prefix are test files. For example, (test_forward)[test_forward.py] is a testing file based on forward-greedy selection.
